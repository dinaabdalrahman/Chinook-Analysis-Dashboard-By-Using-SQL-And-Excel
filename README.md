## Recommendations


- Choosing the right month to release the album or track, for example, July was a month that achieved sales in 2022.
- I see which songs are achieving high sales and I work on increasing their distribution.
- I see the sales of each singer so that I know which singer is popular among the audience and focus on him.
- The most important factor these days is social media in terms of advertising and promoting any new album.
- I try to see what kind of track the generation likes and I start increasing the opportunities to listen to them through social media.
- I put the element of surprise as if it were a competition, so that I create interaction on social media, and consequently,
   it will increase the number of people listening to the song after that.
- For the less popular track, I try to increase the chances of them being performed at concerts and getting sung, so people will start to know them.
- I focus on which age group is most interested in which type of track, and therefore I intensify efforts and work on these types.
- I see what kind of track are popular in each country in order to increase the number of tracks in them.
